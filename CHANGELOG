# 0.7.0

* When outputs don't end in a newline, they will now be surrounded with double
  `----`s and will have `(no newline)` at the end.
* Added `take_arg`, `take_args`, and `expect_empty` for easier parsing of args.
* Removed dependency on `anyhow`, now just a dev-dependency.
* Improved error messages.
